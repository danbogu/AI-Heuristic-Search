# AI-Heuristic-Search
This project (in collaboration with Anat Ben-Haim) is an Artificial Intelligence heuristic search algorithms implementation.
The algorithms in this project are Brach-and-Bound (B&B) and A-star (A*).
Both of them are used to solve the "8-puzzle" problem for a given goal state and use two different heuristics - "Distance Manhattan" and
"Conflict Linear + Distance Manhattan".
The project was written in Python.
